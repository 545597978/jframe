jframe
======
A Java Plugin Framework. Without complex configuration, you can use it now.

## Why do I develop it
* I need a hot deployment system, which support remote update, daemon process, easy configuration, mainly for message processing and ensure that the message is not lost. 
* Osgi is too complex, fully dynamic characteristics is not what I needed most. 
* I think a framework composed by a plug-in, the communication between the plug-in through the message is a good idea.
* So I decided to write a lightweight general framework based on dynamic plugins which communicate via the message.
